## Name
TruNotes

## Description
TruNotes is a note-taking application for the average student, for the working student, and for the organizing student. TruNotes offers an agenda-like to do list, a notebook system, and a flashcards system.

TruNotes allows you to make Folders that each have their own name and list of Pages/Notes in them that are unique to that folder. Each folder will automatically get their own flashcard deck when they are made. You can choose to manually make flashcards or follow our automated flshcard system.

For automated flashcards, you must follow these simple steps!
- When you are in class taking notes:
1. Have a folder for the class you are in or for where you want the flashcards stored if it is different than the class you are in.
2. In the top right of the tool bar, switch on "Auto Flashcards"
- To make each flashcard:
1. Toggle BOLD text with CTRL+B or the "Bold" button.
2. The text you write in bold will become the front of the flashcard.
3. Before you enter a space after the last bold word, unbold and then enter the space character.
4. Anything you write after the space character will be the back of the flashcard.
5. Use a period "." to end the back of the flashcard.

EX// **HTML** stands for hyper text markup language and is used for Web Development.
This will turn into a flashcard with the front being "HTML" and the back being "stands for hyper text markup language and is used for Web Development"

## Visuals

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
