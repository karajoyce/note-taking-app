## TruNotes
TruNotes is a note-taking application for the average student, for the working student, and for the organizing student. TruNotes offers an agenda-like to do list, a notebook system, and a flashcards system.

TruNotes allows you to make Folders that each have their own name and list of Pages/Notes in them that are unique to that folder. Each folder will automatically get their own flashcard deck when they are made. You can choose to manually make flashcards or follow our automated flshcard system explained below in [Usage](#usage).

For automated flashcards, you must follow these simple steps!
- When you are in class taking notes:
1. Have a folder for the class you are in or for where you want the flashcards stored if it is different than the class you are in.
2. In the top right of the tool bar, switch on "Auto Flashcards"
- To make each flashcard:
1. Toggle BOLD text with CTRL+B or the "Bold" button.
2. The text you write in bold will become the front of the flashcard.
3. Before you enter a space after the last bold word, unbold and then enter the space character.
4. Anything you write after the space character will be the back of the flashcard.
5. Use a period "." to end the back of the flashcard.

EX// **HTML** stands for hyper text markup language and is used for Web Development.
This will turn into a flashcard with the front being "HTML" and the back being "stands for hyper text markup language and is used for Web Development"
